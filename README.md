# OJS, OMP, and OPS Testing Datasets

This repository contains data sets generated by the integration test suite built into OJS, OMP, and OPS.

## Layout

The data sets are organized in `application` / `branch or tag name` / `dbms`:

- `application` is `ojs`, `omp`, or `ops`
- `branch name` is e.g. `stable-3_3_0` or `3_3_0-1`
- `dbms` is either `mysql` (MySQL / MariaDB) or `pgsql` (PostgreSQL)

Within each dataset, you will find:

- `database.sql`: Database dump
- `config.inc.php`: OJS configuration file
- `public`: Directory containing the OJS public files
- `files`: Directory containing the OJS `files_dir` (In production this should *not* be web-accessible)

## How this is maintained

OJS, OMP, and OPS contain a [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test suite for setting up a test environment with standardized data ([OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/tree/main/cypress/tests/data) [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp/tree/main/cypress/tests/data) [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/ops/tree/main/cypress/tests/data)). These are called the data tests.

Our github repositories are configured with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) for continuous integration testing -- changes to these repositories result in Travis performing tests and reporting success/failure. This includes running the data tests (but also linting, unit and integration testing, etc).

Some builds in the Travis configuration are flagged using an environment variable (`SAVE_BUILD`; see `.travis.yml`) to indicate that the data resulting from the data tests should be saved. This saving is done in [`run-tests.sh`](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/main/tools/travis/run-tests.sh) just after the data tests complete.

The data is transferred from the Travis VM to this github repository using a ["machine user"](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users) Github account called `pkp-machine-user`. This user has an API token for the purpose, which is provided to Travis using an [encrypted variable in `.travis.yml`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-encrypted-variables-in-travisyml).
